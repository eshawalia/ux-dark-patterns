                   It’s easy to get in, but painfully hard to get out. Users can sign up, subscribe, or add an 
                    account in seconds, yet canceling or deleting requires hidden menus, extra steps, or customer 
                    support hurdles

                <p>
                   A streaming service lets you sign up in two clicks, but canceling requires navigating multiple
                    hidden screens or calling customer support.

                   The roach motel pattern removes a user’s ability to freely leave a product or service. 
                    It exploits inertia and frustration rather than genuine satisfaction, turning what should 
                    be a reversible decision into a psychological and logistical burden. Users feel tricked when 
                    the effort to exit is deliberately higher than the effort to enter, which can create financial 
                    harm and long-term resentment. Over time, this pattern damages brand credibility because people 
                    realize the relationship is being enforced through friction instead of value.

                   Make exiting as easy as entering.
                   Example: A “Cancel subscription” button on the account homepage with a clear one-step 
                    confirmation and no guilt-tripping messages.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design for reversibility and user autonomy. Critical actions like canceling, deleting accounts, 
                    or opting out should be visible, reachable, and comparable in effort to sign-up flows. Use the 
                    principles of transparency and parity—if a process takes one step to begin, it should take one 
                    step to end. Measure success by long-term trust rather than short-term retention metrics.
