                   Wording is intentionally confusing so users choose the option the company wants. 
                    Double negatives, misleading labels, or reversed logic make “yes” feel like “no” 
                    and vice versa.

                   Users would usually check a box to opt in, but due to a subtle change in language 
                    that most users would miss, they instead have to check the box to opt out.

                    Why is it harmful?
                </h2>
                <p>
                   Trick questions take advantage of the way people skim content rather than read every word 
                    carefully. Instead of supporting informed decision-making, the design introduces cognitive 
                    traps that steer users toward the company’s preferred option. This is especially harmful 
                    for accessibility and inclusion, as non-native speakers, older users, or people with 
                    cognitive differences are disproportionately affected. The result is consent that is 
                    technically captured but ethically meaningless, because the user never truly understood 
                    what they agreed to.

                <p>
                    Use plain, direct wording with clear defaults.
                    Example: “Receive promotional emails?” with simple Yes / No options and neutral design.

                <p>
                    Design for clarity over cleverness. Use straightforward language, single-direction logic, 
                    and accessible reading levels. Apply inclusive design practices such as readability testing 
                    and assistive-technology reviews. Consent should be enthusiastic and informed, not extracted 
                    through linguistic puzzles.
